/**
 * Services are the next layer above repositories. Services encapsulate the business logic of the application and consume other 
 * services and repositories but do not consume resources in higher application layers like controllers (again, something that 
 * Spring does not actively enforce). Services are marked with the @Service annotation, making them eligible for automatic 
 * instantiation and dependency injection, among other benefits. Like repositories, services are created from interfaces so that 
 * dependent resources may program against an interface. This pattern of basing each layer on a set of interfaces allows each layer 
 * to be tested in isolation from all the other layers. From a transactional point of view, the execution of a service method from a 
 * higher layer (such as a controller) can be thought of as a transactional unit of work. It may perform several operations on 
 * multiple repositories and other services in the context that all operations must either succeed or fail as a single unit. When a 
 * service method is executed from another service method, it is generally thought of as belonging to the same unit of work that the
 * calling method belongs to.
 * 
 * It should be noted that this concept of unit of work does not imply that it can always be handled with traditional relational 
 * database transactions. The operations performed during a unit of work may have multiple consequences across different data stores
 * or file media. These operations may include transmission of intra- or inter-application messages, e-mails, text messages, or 
 * mobile notifications that in most cases cannot be rolled back.
 * 
 * Some developers do not like to use the term �service� to describe this layer of the application, as that can sometimes be confused
 * with web services. What you call your business logic layer doesn�t matter. You don�t even have to use the @Service annotation. 
 * You could instead use the @Component annotation or a custom annotation meta-annotated with @Component. What you call it and how 
 * you mark it does not change its purpose.
